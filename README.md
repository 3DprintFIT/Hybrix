This is basically a Rebelix with X and Z axis from MK3 as well as MK52 and MK3's extruder.

Build
=====

To continue OpenSCAD has to be installed and available as `openscad` command.

* Make necessary changes to configuration.scad according to printer that prints the parts and available hardware. 
* Generate a calibration object by `make calibration`.
* Print generated calibration.stl and repeat the steps if unhappy.

When satisfied, run `make clean && make all`. That produces STLs with your tweeks.
